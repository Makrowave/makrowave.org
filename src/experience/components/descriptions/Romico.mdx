## Romico GmbH

I currently work as a TypeScript developer at Romico.

I am working at multiple projects using React, React Native, MaterialUI and Mobx.
I am also tasked with improving iOS application.

While working I have deepened my Material UI and React knowledge, learned how to
create commercial software and work with CI/CD pipelines, unit tests and e2e tests.
